Hi, this is going to be a technology blog where I'll keep notes of what I learn that I think can be useful for me in the future and for others.

As I grow old, I find more difficult to remember what I learn so I expect this will help me retain the information or, at least, have a place to go back when I forget.

Expect posts about:

  * automation and orchestration
  * kubernetes, openshift and containers
  * configuration management, mainly Puppet and Ansible
  * network automation
  * cloud services
